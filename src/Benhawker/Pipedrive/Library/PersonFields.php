/**
 * Pipedrive PersonFields Methods
 *
 * PersonFields represent the near-complete schema for a Person in the context of the company of the authorized user.
 * Each company can have a different schema for their Persons, with various custom fields. In the context of using
 * PersonFields as a schema for defining the data fields of a Person, it must be kept in mind that some types of custom
 * fields can have additional data fields which are not separate PersonFields per se. Such is the case with monetary,
 * daterange and timerange fields â€“ each of these fields will have one additional data field in addition to the one
 * presented in the context of PersonFields. For example, if there is a monetary field with the key 'ffk9s9' stored on
 * the account, 'ffk9s9' would hold the numeric value of the field, and 'ffk9s9_currency' would hold the ISO currency
 * code that goes along with the numeric value. To find out which data fields are available, fetch one Person and list
 * its keys.
